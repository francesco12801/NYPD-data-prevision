# NYPD Data Prevision

This project analyzes and predicts NYPD (New York Police Department) data using various data science and machine learning techniques. The project is structured in multiple phases, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following phases:

- `phase1/`: Initial data exploration and preprocessing
- `phase2/`: Feature engineering and analysis
- `phase3/`: Model development and training
- `phase4/`: Final predictions and results
- `dataset/`: Contains the NYPD dataset files

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NYPD-data-prevision.git
cd NYPD-data-prevision
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

Each phase can be run independently. Here's how to execute each phase:

1. Phase 1 - Data Preprocessing:
```bash
python src/phase1/main.py
```

2. Phase 2 - Feature Engineering:
```bash
python src/phase2/main.py
```

3. Phase 3 - Model Training:
```bash
python src/phase3/main.py
```

4. Phase 4 - Predictions:
```bash
python src/phase4/main.py
```

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze and predict NYPD data using machine learning techniques. The analysis is divided into four main phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Initial data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for prediction.
3. **Model Development**: Training and evaluating various machine learning models.
4. **Predictions**: Generating final predictions and analyzing results.
